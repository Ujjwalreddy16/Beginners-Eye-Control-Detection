# 👀 Eye Control Detection (Beginner Project)

This project demonstrates **eye-gaze based control** using Python, OpenCV, and dlib.  
It detects the user's face, tracks eye movement, and can be extended to control applications using just the eyes — making it useful for **assistive technologies** and **hands-free interaction**.
This is a Prototype and Understanding model of Eye Control Project.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time **face and eye detection** using dlib's `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`.
- Detects gaze direction (left, right, center).
- Can be extended to control the mouse, keyboard, or other accessibility tools.
- Beginner-friendly project for computer vision learners.
